# Challenge02-Create a Portfolio

## Create a professional portfolio given the instructions in challenge 2

In this weeks challenge I will build and deploy personal porfolio with no starter code.

- Combined/Consolodated the CSS code to make navigation and changes easier.
- Added sementic elements by reclassifying some of the elements.
- Added alt attributes to some image elements.
- Added multiple comment messages to CSS styling.
- All updates were accomplished without changing mockup provided in instructions. 

Learned to meticulously go through source code and made the necessary changes to prevent future issues.
